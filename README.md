## Introduction

Fast implement of DQN, playing atari games

Usually take one and half hour to reach >300 score in Breakout or >18 in Pong

Test on GTX1080 and i7-6800K, with 16GB memory

Environment pool size and replay buffer size will effect memory usage

The memory usage using default setting is ~7GB
